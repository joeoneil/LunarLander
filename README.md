# LunarLander
Lunar lander game made in monogame for CSH DevCade

Includes a custom (tm) rendering engine for drawing vector graphics in monogame, caused in part by a lack of ability to draw sprites, and a frustration with the fact that you cannot draw a line to the string. 

I also implemented a (semi-faithful) software emulator of the NES sound card thanks to the [fantastic documentation](https://www.nesdev.org/wiki/APU) on the NESdev wiki

This project was developed for [CSH Devcade](https://devcade.csh.rit.edu), which has a vertical ultrawide screen (this should explain the wacky aspect ratio)
